## Journey: Your Trip Planner

Carve your path. Create your journey.

Journey is a simple resource to help you plan your next trip whether you know where to go or not.

### How it works:

* Sign up to create your account. Each user is stored securely in MongoDB Atlas with an encrypted password.
* Create your first trip; it's okay if you don't know where to go.
* Answer all questions - yes, "I don't know" is a valid answer for most of these!
* Get your results
* Export your results into a PDF to take with you on the go
* Access your past trips through your home page after logging in

### Technologies Used:
